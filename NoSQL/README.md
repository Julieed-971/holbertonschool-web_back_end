- The first line of all your files should be a comment: // my comment
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

### Python Scripts

- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` (version 2.5.*)
